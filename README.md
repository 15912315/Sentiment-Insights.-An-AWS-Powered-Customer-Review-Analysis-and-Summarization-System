🔧 Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Upload CSV to S3

Upload your dataset, e.g.

eCommerce_Reviews_500new.csv
eCommerce_Reviews_1000.csv

2️⃣ Lambda Trigger

S3 event triggers first Lambda

Lambda parses CSV → sends text to Comprehend

3️⃣ DynamoDB Tables

ReviewAnalysis1

ReviewSummaries1

4️⃣ Deploy SageMaker Endpoint

From JumpStart:
"Text Summarization – HuggingFace DistilBART / T5"

5️⃣ Generate Summary

Run the second Lambda → stores summary in DynamoDB

6️⃣ Visualize in QuickSight

Connect DynamoDB via Data Source → Dataset → Visualization

🧪 Example Output
Sentiment Classification
Review	Sentiment
“Great product! Love it.”	Positive
“Terrible quality, very disappointed.”	Negative
“Fast delivery but packaging was bad.”	Mixed
AI-Generated Summary
Most customers appreciated the fast delivery service, though concerns were frequently raised about product durability and packaging quality. Customer support received positive mentions, while delayed replacements were common complaints.
